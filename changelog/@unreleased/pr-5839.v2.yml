  description: Users on key-value-services that may not exhibit CAS consistency will
    now automatically have a transaction schema version that _does_ exhibit said consistency
    installed, even if no target schema version or a specific schema version that
    is vulnerable to said inconsistency was configured. Please contact the AtlasDB
    team if you believe this to be an issue.
