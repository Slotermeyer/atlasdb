    See PDS-293157.
    Presently, on each host, the `lastSweptTimestamp` metric is updated lazily per shard as sweep progresses. If a particular host, for some reason, is sweeping with a low frequency, its `lastSweptTimestamp` metric will be out of sync with `shardProgress` and its `millisSinceLastSwept` will show sweep falling behind.

    This PR makes it so we update that metric periodically for all shards by reading and updating from one source: the persisted `shardProgress` table.
